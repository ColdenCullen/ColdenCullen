### What's up I'm Colden, and this is my crib

#### Fun stuff

Most of the repos I have here are weird libraries I felt brifely compelled to build. Some interesting ones:
 * [libtlb](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/libtlb/): A C library for safely distributing I/O work across threads
 * [quack](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/quack): A D library for enforcing safe duck typing (think C++ concepts)
 * [doveralls](https://github.com/ColdenCullen/doveralls): A D tool for uploading D code coverage results to [coveralls.io/](http://coveralls.io/)

#### Work stuff

Current: [Secret Dimension](https://secretdimension.com/)

Past:
* [@GoogleCloudPlatform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/) - GCE virtual networking
* [AWS](https://github.com/awslabs) - The SDK Common Runtime
* [Amazon Lumberyard](https://github.com/aws/lumberyard) - Systems-y and Lua things
